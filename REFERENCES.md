### About the Interferometer (VLTI)  
<https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/telescopes/vlti.html>  
The VLTI combines light from several large telescopes at Paranal to reach very high resolution. By equalizing the light paths and recombining them, it can study details like stars forming around young systems or the centers of galaxies.

### About the Delay Lines  
<https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/telescopes/vlti/subsystems/delaylines.html>  
The Delay Lines are long rail systems that move mirrors on carriages. Their role is to keep light beams from different telescopes arriving at the same time. Sensors and control systems adjust them to micrometer precision.

### Science Description about VLTI (VLTI User Manual)  
<https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/telescopes/vlti/documents/VLT-MAN-ESO-15000-4552_v115.pdf>  
The VLTI User Manual explains how light travels from the telescopes to the lab, how the Delay Lines correct the paths, and how different instruments use the combined beams to measure properties like visibility and phase.

### DELIRIUM Tests: Section 2.3  
<https://www.eso.org/sci/libraries/SPIE2008/7013-11.pdf>  
The DELIRIUM system monitors the shape of the rails used by the Delay Lines. Using sensors, it detects distortions and helps keep the rails straight within a few micrometers, so the optical path remains stable for accurate observations.
